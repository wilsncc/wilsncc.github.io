[{"content":"tl;dr: follow the Manual installation steps and ensure that you have en_US.UTF-8 locale installed (dpkg-reconfigure locales)\nSince I working briefly at a Dutch-Brazilian start-up that ran Service Fabric in production, I have always been curious about it. My first job thereafter was as a platform engineer, specifically focussed on Azure Kubernetes Service; Service Fabric and Kubernetes are often seen as similar, or at lest somewhat comparable.\nI have tried a few times since leaving said start-up to setup a Service Fabric cluster myself. Using the managed Azure service works as expected, but is obviously not free. Creating a self-hosted Windows cluster is pretty straightforward; there\u0026rsquo;s an installer and a special tool that runs in the tray which lets you create or destroy a local 1-node or 5-node cluster with just a click\nBut creating a self-hosted Linux cluster proved to be more challenging.\nThe Microsoft documentation My main issue here is that the documentation is not up to date.\nThere is of course a page on Microsoft Learn which instructs you in how to setup a Service Fabric cluster on Linux, and if you look at the Script installation section, you will find a link to a script hosted on GitHub.\nSaid script contains the following code:\n1 2 3 4 5 Distribution=`lsb_release -cs` if [%[ \u0026#34;xenial\u0026#34; != \u0026#34;$Distribution\u0026#34; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \u0026#34;bionic\u0026#34; != \u0026#34;$Distribution\u0026#34; ]]; then echo \u0026#34;Service Fabric is not supported on $Distribution\u0026#34; exit -1 fi This code causes the script to fail with an error if the version of Ubuntu you are running (did I mention you must only use Ubuntu?) is neither Xenial Xerus (16.04) nor Bionic Beaver (18.04). Whilst both being Long-Term Support releases, at the time of writing, both versions are into their final lifecycle phase i.e. extended security maintenance i.e. critical patches only.\nThis is not what you want for a new production system. Funnily enough, it\u0026rsquo;s also not what Microsoft deliver with their Azure Service Fabric product! Anyway, we know from the Service Fabric release notes that later versions of Ubuntu are supported; versions which are still in the standard support phase. For example, the release notes for Service Fabric 10.1 CU 4 show that the \u0026lsquo;Service Fabric Runtime\u0026rsquo; package supports only \u0026lsquo;Ubuntu 20\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Windows\u0026rsquo;. So, we must surely be able to use Ubuntu 20!\nWell, we can. And it\u0026rsquo;s as simple as following the steps listed in Manual installation instead. This worked for me with an Ubuntu 20.04 VM.\nLocale issue Installation instructions were not the only option. It appears that your OS must be configured with the correct locale i.e. en_US.UTF-8.\nIn my case, servicefabric.service would not start\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 root@ball:/home/ross# systemctl status servicefabric ● servicefabric.service - ServiceFabric Daemon Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/servicefabric.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled) Active: active (running) since Thu 2024-09-26 11:34:45 UTC; 6s ago Main PID: 3504 (starthost.sh) Tasks: 112 (limit: 3410) Memory: 237.1M CGroup: /system.slice/servicefabric.service ├─3504 /bin/bash /opt/microsoft/servicefabric/bin/starthost.sh ├─3616 /opt/microsoft/servicefabric/bin/FabricHost -c -skipfabricsetup ├─3669 /usr/bin/dockerd -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock --pidfile /home/sfuser/sfdevcluster/data/_sf_docker_pid/133718240874061580_sfdocker.pid ├─3697 dotnet FabricCAS.dll └─3698 dotnet FabricDCA.dll Sep 26 11:34:47 ball starthost.sh[3757]: terminating with uncaught exception of type std::runtime_error: collate_byname\u0026lt;char\u0026gt;::collate_byname failed to construct for en_US.UTF-8 Sep 26 11:34:47 ball starthost.sh[3774]: terminating with uncaught exception of type std::runtime_error: collate_byname\u0026lt;char\u0026gt;::collate_byname failed to construct for en_US.UTF-8 Sep 26 11:34:47 ball starthost.sh[3808]: terminating with uncaught exception of type std::runtime_error: collate_byname\u0026lt;char\u0026gt;::collate_byname failed to construct for en_US.UTF-8 Sep 26 11:34:47 ball starthost.sh[3807]: terminating with uncaught exception of type std::runtime_error: collate_byname\u0026lt;char\u0026gt;::collate_byname failed to construct for en_US.UTF-8 Sep 26 11:34:48 ball starthost.sh[3669]: time=\u0026#34;2024-09-26T11:34:48.200147262Z\u0026#34; level=info msg=\u0026#34;Default bridge (docker0) is assigned with an IP address 172.17.0.0/16.

It doesn\u0026rsquo;t always have to be something immediately useful or relevant to my personal life or my career. If it\u0026rsquo;s mildly interesting, it will do.\nBut for the things I do want to put to use, for the things I want to remember, I know there are tools out there to help make it possible in the most efficient way discovered so far; spaced repetition.\nIf you know what spaced repetition is, you probably know about Anki. It\u0026rsquo;s the canonical spaced repetition software, although there are others e.g. Mnemosyne. However, there is another piece of software which has ostensibly more claim to the title of most significant spaced repetition software; SuperMemo.\nSuperMemo For an answer to the question \u0026ldquo;what is SuperMemo\u0026rdquo;, the SuperMemo wiki explains it best. Quoting:\nThe three most important facts about SuperMemo\nSuperMemo is a learning method that makes it possible to learn \u0026gt; fast and retain memories for years SuperMemo is available as an easy computer program for Windows, Android, iOS, web browser, and more SuperMemo is based on the science of long-term memory The first point seems to be supported by the enough happy users.\nThe second point is somewhat misleading; the original SuperMemo software is only available on Windows desktop PCs; there is also SuperMemo.com but that\u0026rsquo;s basically language learning SaaS. It does not provide anything like what SuperMemo provides on Windows.\nThe third point is the most interesting. The company behind SuperMemo includes published researchers who have studied human memory such that they have build a model of how we remember (and forget), and then implemented that into their SuperMemo algorithm.\nConsidering that Anki\u0026rsquo;s algorithm is based on the SuperMemo\u0026rsquo;s SM2 algorithm, the importance and relevance of SuperMemo and their work become apparent. But SM2 was created and published to the world in 1990; 34 years hence, a lot has changed in the world.\nWhat, then, has an extra three decades brought to the first and leading computerised spaced repetition system\u0026rsquo;s user experience and algorithm?\nMy experience This year I built a Windows PC for gaming. It has been a long time since I have had a Windows machine, so only recently have I had the chance to experiment with SuperMemo.\nNow, having done so for the past few weeks, I can summarise my experience in one word: disappointing.\nUser Interface SuperMemo 19 is a Delphi app which has been dragged, kicking and screaming, from the 90s through to today. And it really shows.\nThe UI has different \u0026rsquo;levels':\nBeginner Basic Middle Professional This level has an optional \u0026lsquo;Warrior Layout\u0026rsquo; Already your alarm bells should be ringing.\nThe lower levels hide much of the basic functionality you would want. The middle levels reveal some of that functionality. The higher levels use the rather horrible Multiple-document interface pattern, making usage across multiple monitors very painful or impossible.\nAdding or Editing Content The \u0026rsquo;element editor\u0026rsquo; is painful. Setting consistent theming for the content you want to add is unnecessary complex and rather esoteric. It\u0026rsquo;s not that it\u0026rsquo;s crucial for learning content to be replete with fancy fonts and effects; but learning should be enjoyable. Enjoyment contributes positively to the capacity to learn and remember.\nWhy then should you have to run a gauntlet of fire to theme your rich text with an alternative background colour and font colour? To that, I can find no acceptable answer.\nThe SuperMemo Algorithm and FSRS Above all else, what SuperMemo has is the proprietary algorithm. Some of SuperMemo\u0026rsquo;s proponents make no secret of the fact that they see past all of SuperMemo\u0026rsquo;s flaws, just to be able to use the algorithm.\nIn my (limited) experience, the algorithm does not perform significantly better than Anki does, especially with the new FSRS algorithm.\nAnd even if it did, the rest of the application makes \u0026rsquo;learning\u0026rsquo; a torturous process.\nAt the same time, other researchers have shared their work in developing their own novel spaced-repetition algorithms, attempting too to model the human memory. The most well known of these being FSRS, though Maimemo\u0026rsquo;s SSP-MMC is also publicly available.\nThe Future of SuperMemo SuperMemo seems to be the (pet) project of one main character, Piotr A. Wozniak, author of the research papers linked above.\nIn recent discussions, Mr. Wozniak has made clear that he quite likes his Windows desktop-oriented workflow, and does not see a need for this to change.\nBoth he and SuperMemo World, the company behind SuperMemo, have no plans to open source the algorithm they have historically claimed to be far more advanced and superior to the others in the market.\nConsidering the above, SuperMemo World appear to have a real \u0026lsquo;bus problem\u0026rsquo;. If the algorithm is as good as is claimed, it seems a real tragedy that there is no intention to share it with the world, to allow a more usable, more likeable software package to spread the apparent miracle of the SuperMemo algorithm with the world.\nIn short, the future of SuperMemo and its algorithm does not seem particularly bright.\nConclusion Many people love Anki; many hate it. A far smaller number of people love SuperMemo; I would suppose, even fewer people (proportionally) hate SuperMemo.\nIt is a piece of software with a real cult following; I mean that in a sincere way, like cult movies, and not like Aum Shinrikyo. Said cult revolves around both SuperMemo and Mr. Wozniak. Since the former is the decades long brainchild of the latter, and it embodies his own personal and professional opinions about what works and what doesn\u0026rsquo;t, the two are linked in a very interesting way that goes beyond simply a piece of software and its (sole?) developer. A unique form of symbiosis which I have never seen before.\nTo really buy into SuperMemo, you have to buy into the cult. That\u0026rsquo;s a hard sell when even some of the most vocal advocates for SuperMemo online are finding that the time has come to let go, and to move on.\nConsidering all of the above, it would be a hard sell were it free of charge. At $70.00 USD, the writing is on the wall.\n","date":"2024-10-17T09:59:00+02:00","permalink":"https://wilsn.cc/2024/10/on-supermemo/","title":"On SuperMemo"},{"content":"Recently I was asked for some resources for learning Dutch at an intermediate/advanced level. Rather than just list a bunch of textbooks and websites, I\u0026rsquo;ve written up some advice on how to actually do the language learning. Working smarter, not harder, etc.\nSorry if this was more than you were looking for.\nLanguage is sounds With the exception of sign languages, all languages are spoken. The words we read and write simply represent the sounds. We were speaking for many, many years before we ever invented writing systems.\nSadly, many people across the world are illiterate; it says something important that they can speak and listen, but cannot read or write. Research shows us that babies can hear and understand what we say long before they can speak, though we don\u0026rsquo;t need science to tell us that they can speak long before they start learning the alphabet.\nIf it’s not clear already, speaking and listening are language, they are king and queen of communicating. Because language is sounds, and written words simply represent those sounds.\nPerfecting how well you can understand what is spoken, and also the sounds that you speak, is key to perfecting your language ability. Mistakes that you make already will become fossilised and more difficult to correct, the longer you make them.\nTip 1: Deliberate Listening Practice Find good quality audio from a speaker with a standard accent and listen to it deliberately. This is active listening.\nListen to a large chunk of it (some 3 to 5 minutes) all the way through. Try to understand as much as you can. Listen to it again a few times.\nTry and write down the words you don’t recognise. If your listening skills are good and you at least understand the writing system, you will be able to make a good guess at how the word should be written, which will let you look it up if you wish.\nFor Dutch, the Tweede Kamer record their debates, committees, votes, plenary sessions and so on, and upload them to Debat Gemist; you may need to click \u0026ldquo;Zoek Debatten\u0026rdquo; on the top right to be able to find a list of possible debates.\nTip 2: All Dutch, All The Time Don’t do something in another language if you can try it in Dutch! This applies everywhere:\nInteractions in public, at work or at home Your computer or mobile phone’s display language Television, radio, magazines and websites Similarly, try passive listening link 1 link 2.; half-listening to Dutch podcasts, videos or even music whilst you do other things.\nFor this and the tip above, nothing beats a cheap pair or Bluetooth earphones. If you don\u0026rsquo;t already have something suitable, something like these would be ideal. Keep them on you all the time, it will let you make use of any spare time you can: on public transport; at work whilst you are doing something easy or repetitive; before bedtime, etc.\nBy doing this, you are exposing yourself to the language\u0026rsquo;s sounds over and over again. This is important for the reasons listed earlier on.\nTip 3: Try Chorusing And Shadowing Chorusing and shadowing are two techniques to help you perfect the sounds of the language, both in your mind and in your voice.\nThe technique is basically just recording yourself repeatedly repeating native audio until you get it mostly perfect. The difference between chorusing and shadowing is largely just when you speak; either at the same time as the native audio, or directly after.\nI will direct you to this website for some handy videos on how to do this.\nIt might seem strange to do this, but it is very effective.\nWorking Smart Beats Working Hard Tip 4: Use Spaced Repetition Software (i.e. Anki) So much has been written about SRS and Anki which is better than I could write, that I’ll just give you some one-liners and ask you to google them:\nSRS, or spaced repetition system, is basically a system that prompts you to review and recall information at optimum moment, so that you don’t work more than you have to and yet also don’t forget; usually this takes the form of flashcards. Anki is the canonical SRS software, free and open source on PC/Mac, free on Android as AnkiDroid and paid for approx. 29€ (one-off) on iOS. For a more detailed, algorithmic look at Anki and SRS, please see this amazing blog post.\nAdditionally, there are very many \u0026ldquo;Anki decks\u0026rdquo; which are available to download for free, many of which are of great quality (I have made a couple myself!) There are also some for sale but I would try your luck with free resources first.\nBy using these, you will optimise your time and effort, minimising the amount of time you need to spend studying by reviewing only what you need to to avoid forgetting, at the last possible moment.\nTip 5: A Little Bit Every Day Beats A Large Chunk Now And Then Linked to the above, it’s far better to study a little often, than to wait until the weekend and then do some hours.\nBy all means, spend those hours on the weekend if you want, but not at the expense of those 15 minutes a day. 15 minutes a day should be your goal, every single day. It can be hard, but is definitely doable. Once you make a habit of it, it will be easier to stick to.\nOnly you know what suits your lifestyle, but this approach is proven to work, so try your best to make it work for you.\nTip 6: Try Memory Techniques Again, I will defer to others who have written far more eloquently than I can about this topic, but learning in particular about how to build and use a memory palace is a very good idea.\nDr Lynne Kelly has authored a great book on the topic of memory techniques and the people over at the Art of Memory forum are very kind and helpful. Anthony Metivier has also written a great number of books on this topic; this one on German vocabulary would be very helpful learning [[Dutch]] too, since the memory techniques are language-agnostic and German is so similar to [[Dutch]] f these memory tools.\nThe Right Resources Last A Lifetime Tip 7: find a teacher Language may be one of the most difficult things to teach yourself\nFor one, it\u0026rsquo;s not too easy to correct yourself. You can\u0026rsquo;t just put some words into a calculator and check if they match some predetermined answer. Since there are often multiple ways to express the same idea, it can be hard to give useful question and answer sets.\nAny good teacher will be able to correct you in realtime, helping to avoid fossilised mistakes. Good teachers have studied teaching and have studied learning, meaning that they should be able to help you determine what things to study and how best to approach it.\nIn the Netherlands, I can certainly recommend UvA Talen\u0026rsquo;s group courses; I took their Chinese classes for some time, until the timing no longer suited my lifestyle.\nOtherwise, italki.com lets you browse and select a language teacher for just about any language. Again, I use this too for Chinese; there will be Dutch teachers on their but they will be more expensive than the ones I am seeing!\nTip 8: buy the right textbooks It goes without saying that you should certainly have a textbook. But which one? That is a difficult question to answer without having seen a lot of textbooks!\nFor Dutch, the website NT2.nl is best (by law, all books in Dutch sold new in the Netherlands must be priced the same, so don\u0026rsquo;t bother shopping around).\nFor grammar, the Klare Taal! series is very good. I have these. You will also need a dictionary, and Van Dale and famous for those. I had one of these too. Good luck, and have fun!\n","date":"2024-02-23T21:10:00+02:00","permalink":"https://wilsn.cc/2024/02/language-tips-for-intermediate/","title":"Language tips for Intermediate"},{"content":"This article offers a sample of basic Markdown syntax that can be used in Hugo content files, also it shows whether basic HTML elements are decorated with CSS in a Hugo theme.\nHeadings The following HTML \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;—\u0026lt;h6\u0026gt; elements represent six levels of section headings. \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt; is the highest section level while \u0026lt;h6\u0026gt; is the lowest.\nH1 H2 H3 H4 H5 H6 Paragraph Xerum, quo qui aut unt expliquam qui dolut labo.
